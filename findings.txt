Summarise your findings here (see specification).

Results:
- Mystery1: Sudoku board of “extremely hard” difficulty.
- Mystery2: Sudoku board that is impossible to solve.
- Mystery3: Sudoku board of "hard” difficulty.

Explanation:
- The algorithm that was written was unable to obtain a solution for Mystery2 whereas it could obtain solutions
for Mystery1 and Mystery3, so Mystery2 was concluded to be impossible to solve.

- Using functions to measure the time taken for each board to be solved (see main.cpp):
Mystery3 was generally 30 times faster to produce a solution as compared to Mystery1. 
Hence, conlcuding that Mystery3 is of easier difficulty than Mystery1.
